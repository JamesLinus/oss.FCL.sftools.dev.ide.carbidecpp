		<para>
		  Hover Help provides a link
		  between the Carbide IDE and the Symbian OS C++ Developer Library. When activated, Hover Help
		  provides developers with easy access to the API reference documentation. When a
		  user hovers over a C++ API item, such as a class name, the editor shows the documentation for that API
		  reference.
		</para> 
		<para>
		  Hover Help uses <emph>Developer Library plug-ins</emph>. These are Eclipse
		  documentation plug-ins that contain the information displayed when an
		  API reference item is hovered over.
		</para> 
		<para>
		  You can download Developer Library plug-ins from the
		  <uri target="http://symbianfoundation.org/">Symbian Foundation</uri> website.
