# Eclipse runtime configuration file
# This file contains a number of key/value pairs that are merged into the 
# System properties on system startup.  The values control the way the 
# runtime is structured and runs.

# Note:  Only platform:/base/ and file: URLs are supported.  In general the 
# URLs given may include a version number (e.g., .../location_1.2.3).  
# If a version is not specified, the system binds
# to the location which matches exactly or to the versioned location with the
# latest version number.  If a version number is given then only exact matches
# are considered.

# The comma-separated list of locations to search for the splash screen file (splash.bmp).
# For each list element a subdirectory structure based on the pattern nl/<locale> is searched.
# The system binds to the first matching file.  There is no default value.
osgi.splashPath = platform:/base/plugins/com.nokia.carbide.cpp

# The comma-separated list of bundles which are automatically installed and optionally started
# once the system is up and running.  Each entry if of the form
#     <URL | simple bundle location>[@ [<startlevel>] [":start"]]
# If the startlevel is omitted then the framework will use the default start level for the bundle.
# If the "start" tag is added then the bundle will be marked as started after being installed.
# Simple bundle locations are interepreted as relative to the framework's parent directory.
# The startlevel indicates the OSGi start level at which the bundle should run.
# If this value is not set, the system computes an appropriate default.
osgi.bundles=org.eclipse.equinox.common@2:start, org.eclipse.update.configurator@3:start, org.eclipse.core.runtime@start

# The product to run.  A given Eclipse configuration may contain many products.
# The product identified will supply the branding (window icons, title bar text) etc 
# as well as define the default application to run.  
#eclipse.product=org.eclipse.platform.ide
eclipse.product=com.nokia.carbide.cpp.product

# The default workspace location
#osgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/workspace
# Default to a name without spaces. Many Symbian Perl scripts will fail on paths with spaces in them.
osgi.instance.area.default=C:/Symbian/Carbide/workspace

# The build identifier
eclipse.buildId=I20080617-2000
