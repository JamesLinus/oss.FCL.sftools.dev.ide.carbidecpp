    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eclipse Debugger for C/C++</strong><strong> </strong>&mdash; Carbide now uses the <strong>Eclipse Debugger for C/C++</strong> (EDC) as its default debugger. EDC provided an entirely new Debug view with all of the standard debug features like variables, breakpoints, watchpoints, disassembly, and all the other views required to run a debugging session. In addition, EDC provides the framework to add new debug features like snapshots.</li>
      <li><b>TCF Debug Agents</b> &ndash; Using Eclipse&rsquo;s Target Configuration Framework, a new set of debug agents are used with the new EDC debugger to provide a completely new end-to-end debug environment. </li>
      <li><b>CODA</b> replaces <b>TRK</b> as the debug agent on remote devices. CODA (Carbide On-device Debug Agent) uses the TCF interface to provide improved communication support between the Carbide debugger and the remote device.</li>
      <li><b>Plug-n-Play Debug Discovery</b> &ndash; a new method where Carbide can detect a debug target (phone device, PlatSim, etc) and automatically connect and configure the target so debugging can be initiated.</li>
      <li><b>Snapshots</b> &ndash; Save the state of a debug session for later review. Multiple snapshots are stored in a debug album to be shared with others or used for comparing different debug sessions.</li>
      <li><b>New SDK Manager</b> &ndash; The developer can add and manage SDKs in the Symbian SDKs panel. The tool lists all available SDKs and can rescan system drives for newly installed and supported SDKs.</li>
      <li><b>Improved Raptor support</b> &ndash; The Build Configuration Filter selects which platforms are visible when creating new projects or build configurations. The results of this preference panel are used to populate the build configurations when importing new projects.</li>
      <li><b>New Carbide.c++ portal view</b> &ndash; The new <a href="reference/view_carbide_portal.htm">Carbide.c++ Portal</a> view provides easier access to
          <ul>
              <li> Welcome and getting started information including videos, blogs, and much more</li>
              <li>Installing and updating Symbian SDKs using the SDK Manager</li>
              <li>Customizing the Carbide workspace to better suit your needs</li>
              <li>Support information</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Customized Carbide environment</strong> &mdash; Carbide introduces Plugin Discovery Sites where you can search for and download Carbide plugins to customize your Carbide environment. Think of it as an app store for plugins. It uses the Eclipse P2 feature  to provide a common framework for finding, installing, updating, and removing plugins from the Carbide environment.</li>
      <li><strong>Improved UI</strong> &mdash; Carbide's UI has been streamlined and minimized to a core set of functionality, mainly that of creating Symbian projects, building and debugging them. Context menus have been reworked to show a minimum set of options. If your favorite option is missing, you can use the <strong>Capability</strong> preference panel or the <strong>Customize Perspective</strong> dialog to add favorite commands back onto the context menus.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance improvements</strong> &mdash; We continue to address known performance issues as they reveal themselves. This release provides improvements for:
          <ul>
                  <li><strong>Stack frames</strong> &mdash; in the Debug view stack frames were displayed once the symbol tables were completely read. For large symbol files this sometimes slowed down the display and hence the ability to continue debugging. Now the Debug view will show a subset of stack frames after a set time and update the remainder once it has finished scanning the symbol file.</li>
              <li><strong>Executables view</strong> &mdash; eliminated several use cases that forced the Executables list to update to frequently.</li>
              <li><strong>Large symbol tables</strong> supported &mdash; The Carbide symbol reader has been rewritten to provide faster access to symbols and to handle very large symbol files (larger than 10GB).</li>
          </ul>
