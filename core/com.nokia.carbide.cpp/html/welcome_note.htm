<h2>Welcome to Carbide.c++ 2.2.0</h2>
<p>Thank you for installing Carbide.c++2.2! It's an improvement over 2.1 with many improvements including support for Eclipse 3.5 and CDT 6.0, as well as numerous bug fixes. </p>
<p>However, perhaps the best part about Carbide.c++ is the Carbide.c++ Development Kit (CDK) that you can use to build custom extensions for Carbide.c++. <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.nokia.carbide.cpp.doc.user/html/tasks/start/carbide_updating.htm">Update</a> your installation of Carbide through the Carbide.c++ update site to get a copy of the CDK. Take a look, and let us know what you built!</p>
<p>Finally, if you find bugs, please let us know by submitting it at the new Carbide Bugzilla bug tracking site located at <a href="https://xdabug001.ext.nokia.com/bugzilla">https://xdabug001.ext.nokia.com/bugzilla</a> </p>
<p>For any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
<p> Thank you again for choosing Carbide.c++! We hope you like it. </p>
