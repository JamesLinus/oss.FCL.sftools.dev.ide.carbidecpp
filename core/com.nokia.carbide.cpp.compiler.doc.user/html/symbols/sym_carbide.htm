<h3>Carbide.c++ Predefined Symbols</h3>
<p>  Table 1 lists additional symbols provided by Carbide C/C++ but not defined as part of the ANSI/ISO C/C++ standards.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong> The Carbide C compiler was formerly known as the Metrowerks C compiler. For Symbian development, only the x86 based features are supported. All references to other processor architectures are for historical purposes only. </p>
