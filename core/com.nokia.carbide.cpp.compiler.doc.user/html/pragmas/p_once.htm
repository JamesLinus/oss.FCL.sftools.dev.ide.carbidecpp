<h3>once</h3>
<p>  Controls whether or not a header file can be included more than once in the same compilation unit.  </p>
<h5>Syntax</h5>
  <p class="code">#pragma once [ on ]
  </p>
  <h5>Targets</h5>
  All platforms.<br />
  <h5>Remarks</h5>
  <p>Use this pragma to ensure that the compiler includes header files only once in a source file. This pragma is especially useful in precompiled header files.</p>
  <p>    There are two versions of this pragma: <span class="code">#pragma once</span> and <span class="code">#pragma once on</span>. Use<span class="code"> #pragma once</span> in a header file to ensure that the header file is included only once in a source file. Use <span class="code">#pragma once on</span> in a header file or source file to insure that any file is included only once in a source file.</p>
  <p>Be aware that when using <span class="code">#pragma once on</span>, precompiled headers might not necessarily transfer from machine to machine and provide the same results. This is because the full paths of included files are stored to distinguish between two distinct files that have identical filenames but different paths. Use the warn_pch_portability pragma to issue a warning when <span class="code">#pragma once</span> on is used in a precompiled header. For more information, see <span class="code">pragma <a href="p_warn_pch_portability.htm">warn_pch_portability</a></span>.</p>
  <p>This pragma does not correspond to any panel setting. The default setting is <span class="code">off</span>.</p>
