<h3>When to Use Precompiled Files</h3>
<p>Source code files in a project typically use many header files. Typically, the same header files are included by each source code file in a project, forcing the compiler to read these same header files repeatedly during compilation. To shorten the time spent compiling and recompiling the same header files, Carbide C/C++ can precompile a header file, allowing it to be subsequently preprocessed much faster than a regular text source code file.</p>
<p>For example, as a convenience, programmers often create a header file that contains commonly-used preprocessor definitions and includes frequently-used header files. This header file is then included by each source code file in the project, saving the programmer some time and effort while writing source code.</p>
<p>This convenience comes at a cost, though. While the programmer saves time typing, the compiler does extra work, preprocessing and compiling this header file each time it compiles a source code file that includes it.</p>
<p>This header file can be precompiled so that, instead of preprocessing multiple duplications, the compiler needs to load just one precompiled header file. </p>
