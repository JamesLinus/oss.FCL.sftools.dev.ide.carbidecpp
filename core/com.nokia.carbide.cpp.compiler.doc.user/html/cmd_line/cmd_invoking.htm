<h3>Invoking Command-Line Tools</h3>
<p>  To compile, assemble, link, or perform some other programming task with the Carbide command-line tools, type a command at the command-line prompt. This command specifies what tool to run, what options to use while the tool runs, and on what files the tool should operate.</p>
<p>The tool performs the operation on the files you specify. If the tool successfully finishes its operation, a new prompt appears on the command line. Otherwise, it reports any problems as text messages on the command line before a new prompt appears. The tools include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="code">mwccsym2</span> &#8212; x86 C/C++ compiler</li>
  <li><span class="code">mwldsym2</span> &#8212; x86 linker</li>
  <li><span class="code">mwc++filt</span> &#8212; x86 filter</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them can be found in <span class="code">\Nokia\Carbide.c++ &lt;version&gt;\x86Build\Symbian_Tools\Command_Line_Tools.</span></p>
<p>You can also write scripts that automate the process to build your software. Scripts contain a list of command-line tools to invoke, one after another. For example, the <span class="code">make</span> tool, a common software development tool, uses scripts to manage dependencies among source code files and invoke command-line compilers, assemblers, and linkers as needed, much like the Carbider IDE&rsquo;s project manager.</p>
<p>Commands follow this convention:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code">tool [options] [files] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>where tool is the name of the Carbide command-line tool to invoke, options is a list of zero or more options that tell the tool what operation it should perform and how to perform it, and files is a list of zero or more files on which the tool should operate. Which options and files you use depends on what operation you want the tool to perform.<br />
