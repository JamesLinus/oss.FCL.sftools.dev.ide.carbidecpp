<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>LeaveScan is a useful tool that can be used regularly against your source code. LeaveScan is a command-line utility developed by Symbian Ltd that verifies that your code respects the naming conventions for leaving functions.</p>
<p>LeaveScan checks that all functions which have the potential to leave are named according to the Symbian OS convention, with a trailing L. Any function that Leaves, or calls a function that Leaves (other than in a TRAP harness), must have a name ending in L. LeaveScan can be used on your source to indicate areas of code where you may have forgotten to use the naming convention.      By revealing where leaves may occur but are not indicated by the function name, it highlights potential bugs and gives you an opportunity to fix the problem and ensure that your code handles any leaves correctly. </p>
