   <h2>AIF Editor</h2>
	  
	 <p>
		The <b>AIF Editor</b> allows you to specify the Symbian OS
		resource file and bitmaps that should be included in a Symbian OS application
		information (AIF) file. Use of AIF files is restricted to using <span class="filename">.bmp</span> files and works for versions 2.x and later releases of the Symbian OS SDKs. For more information, see <a href="../concepts/AIFDefWizard.html">AIF File</a>.</p>
	 <p>
		The AIF Editor is shown when a new AIF file is created or an existing file is edited in the Resources group of the MMP editor's  Sources tab. Refer to <a href="../tasks/AppInfoFile.html">Creating an AIF File</a> for more information.</p>
