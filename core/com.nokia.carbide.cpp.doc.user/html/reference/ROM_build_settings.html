   <h2>ROM Builder pane </h2>
   <p>Use the <b>ROM Builder</b> pane to specify commands and a working directory for building a GUI ROM Image. The tool used to build GUI ROM images is called buildrom and can typically be found in your SDK path, for example in the <span class="code">\Symbian\9.1\S60_3rd\Epoc32\tools</span> directory. The tool used to build text shell images is called ROM. The ROM image generated from the ROM building process specifies a base address for the image to run at. This might be an address in RAM or ROM. The image must be downloaded to the device at this address.</p>
   <p>Building a ROM requires that the following are available, or have been successfully created:</p>
   <ul>
     <li> Symbian OS components making up a set of releasables</li>
     <li> a Bootstrap binary image</li>
     <li> a text file specifying how the ROM image is to be built.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Rom build assembles executable and data files into a ROM image.</p>
   <p>Executables are pre-processed, relocated, and have their imports and exports bound for a ROM image based at some given virtual address. The files, base address of the ROM, and various other parameters are specified by means of the obey file. This is a file of type .oby and is a text file containing statements that specify how the ROM image is to be built. A .oby file can include other files in the same way that files containing C++ source can #include other C++ files. By convention, the included files have the .iby file type. This structure allows flexibility in the way that ROM images are defined.</p>
   <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> The ROM image will be rebuilt for any target whenever a change to the project occurs; except for WINSCW targets.</p>
