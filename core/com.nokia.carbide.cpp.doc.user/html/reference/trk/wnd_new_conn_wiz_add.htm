<h3><strong><a name="CONN_SET" id="INSTALL2"></a></strong>Set Connection Settings pane</h3>
<p>Use  the <b>Set Connection Settings</b> pane to compare the version of remote agent installed on the device with the latest version available for Carbide. In this pane you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set  the device OS used by the device and supported by the selected remote agent</li>
  <li>Allow easy serial port selection when connecting to a device </li>
  <li>Verify that you have the latest remote agent installed on a device</li>

    <td>A dropdown list of serial ports with known identifiers for selecting the communication port used by the PC to communicate with the device. A named COM port (<span class="code">COM4 - BthModem0</span>) indicates an active port. Unnamed port numbers have usually not been opened and assigned by the PC.</td>

    <td>Click to select a listed service for testing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Test Service Status</strong></td>
    <td><p>Click <strong>Test Service Status</strong> to query the remote agent software on the device for its version number. It then compares the version number found with the latest version available for Carbide. A progress bar will appear should the Check TRK version operation requires more than a few seconds.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong> The PC must have an internet connection to perform a remote agent version check.</p>
      <p>Once the comparison is complete the Status text is updated with the result and further instructions as required.</p>

      <p align="left">If a connection fails, the errors normally fall into these two categories: </p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>connection failure</strong> - this usually indicates the chosen COM port  is not open. Try selecting a different COM port, specifically one with a name attached to it (<span class="code">COM4 - BthModem0</span>) for the type of connection you are using (USB or Bluetooth). Repeat as necessary until you get a successful response. </li>
        <li><strong>TRK not responding</strong> - this indicates that the COM port is open but TRK is not responding. First, verify that TRK is up and running on the device. Second, TRK may be listening on a different COM port, so choose another named COM port and try again.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p></td>

<h3><strong><a name="INSTALL" id="INSTALL"></a>Install Remote Agents</strong> pane</h3>

    <td><p>A list of the most current versions of remote agents sorted by SDK and version. Select the version most compatable with the device. For example, a device running S60 3.1.0 needs a version of the TRK software compiled for that SDK, which in the image above is Application TRK 2.8.7. </p>
        <p>Additional information about the selected entry is displayed to the right to help you choose the correct version of TRK for the target device. </p></td>
