<h2>MBM/MIF Editor</h2>
	  
	 <p>The <b>MIF Editor</b> allows you to create or edit the <span class="code">.mif</span> files list of scalable icons (<span class="code">.svg</span>)
     included in  a S60 v3.0 and later GUI projects as well as standard <span class="code">.bmp</span> files. A .mif file is a MSX Interchange Format (MIF) file that should be built by the project. MIF files replace the functionality of AIF (and MBM) files.</p>
   <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> This editor is only supported by the S60 3.0  and later SDKs.</p>
	 <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> For resources that are included after creating a project, you should ensure that the output location is set correctly by viewing the file properties. The output location is set to &quot;<span class="code">{EPOCROOT}\epoc32\include</span>&quot; by default, so if an alternate location is required you can set this in the file properties.</p>

   <p>The <b>MIF Editor</b> appears when a MIF  file is
   opened for editing. To open the editor double-click on a .mif file in the <a href="view_sym_proj_nav.htm">Symbian Project Navigator</a> view (figure 1), or select a scalable icon makefile (for example, <span class="code">Icons_scalable_dc.mk</span>), right-click and select the <b>Add MBM/MIF Entry</b> command.</p>
