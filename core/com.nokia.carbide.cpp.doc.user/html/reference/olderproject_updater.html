   <h2>Updating Projects</h2>
   
   <p>
   The <b>Carbide.c++ File Updater</b> window appears when you open Carbide.c++ 1.1 projects in Carbide.c++ 1.2. The example in figure 1 shows the Carbide.c++ File Updater window with an older project that needs updated. If your projects have up-to-date bld.inf and MMP files, it is recommended to delete the existing Carbide.c++ projects and re-import your projects from the bld.inf file. New bld.inf and MMP files will be created from the existing projects. The updater will update the template 
   projects from Carbide.c++ 1.1. </p>
   <p>You can also select projects in the C/C++ Projects or Symbian Project Navigator view and choose Project &gt; Update Projects command to display the Carbide.c++ File Updater dialog.</p>
