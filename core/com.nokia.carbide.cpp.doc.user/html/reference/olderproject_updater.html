   <h2>Updating Projects</h2>
   
   <p>
   The <b>Carbide.c++ File Updater</b> window appears when you open older Carbide.c++  projects that require updating. This most often occurs when new features are added to the project file format. The example in figure 1 shows the Carbide.c++ File Updater window with a v1.1 project that needs updating. In this case the updater  updates the template 
   projects from Carbide.c++ 1.1 to the latest template version. Projects that are already up-to-date are not affected by the updater process. New projects automatically use the most current project format.</p>
   <p>If your projects have up-to-date <span class="code">bld.inf</span> and <span class="code">MMP</span> files, it is recommended that you delete the existing Carbide.c++ projects and simply re-import them from the <span class="code">bld.inf</span> file. This ensures that the project file format is up-to-date. </p>
   <p>You can also select projects in the <a href="view_cpp_projects.htm">Project Explorer</a> or <a href="view_sym_proj_nav.htm">Symbian Project Navigator</a> views and choose <b>Project &gt; Update Projects</b> command to display the Carbide.c++ File Updater window.</p>

   <h3><a name="uid" id="uid"></a>UI Designer Projects</h3>
   <p>If you are opening older projects that include UI Designer components, an error message will appear similar to the one shown in figure 2. Click OK to open the Carbide.c++ Files Updater window shown in figure 3.</p>

   <p>Changes to be performed by the updater are shown in the Text Compare area. You can use the yellow up and down arrows to move to the next or previous change to be performed. Click cancel if you do not want the change to be made. Click Finish to accept the changes. </p>
