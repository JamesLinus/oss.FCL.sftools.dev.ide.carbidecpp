   <h2>MMP Editor</h2>
   
   <p>
   The MMP Editor allows you to view and modify your project definitions.  Changes made in the MMP editor are automatically written to the project's .MMP file. You can view the .mmp file by selecting the <em>project_name</em>.mmp tab located along the bottom of the MMP editor.</p>
   <p>
	  The MMP Editor is shown when an MMP  file is
   opened from the Project Explorer, C/C++ Projects, or Symbian Project Navigator views. The MMP Editor is shown in Figure 1. MMP editor fields are validated for existing or correct entries. For example, if the UID 2 field is blank the label is highlighted in red. If an error exists in the mmp file, the line where the error occurs is marked and also displayed in the Problems view.</p>

			   <li>For GUI applications, it is always 0x100039CE</li>
			   <li>For static interface DLLs, the UID 2 is always 0x1000008d</li>

	 <p>Any changes made to the MMP file either in Carbide or using an external editor are detected. If the build is for emulation, these changes are detected and used automatically. </p>
	 <p>For other build types like GCCE you are  presented with the <b>Modified MMP Files Detected</b> dialog (Figure 2) and asked which build action to take for each MMP file that has changed. Set the build option for each listed MMP file and click <b>OK</b>.</p>
