<h2>Executables view </h2>
<p>  The <b>Executables</b> view provides a dynamic list of executables and their related source files. The Executables view makes it easy to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>target all binaries for debugging because the symbolics are automatically loaded when a bld.inf is imported or a project is created from a template</li>
  <li>debug a binary that is not part of a project in the workspace by importing it into the Executables view to load the symbolics</li>
  <li> debug a process running on a device by <a href="../tasks/processes/attach_debugger_to_process.htm">attaching</a> to the process and importing the binaries associated with the process into the Executables view to load the symbolics. For example, you to debug a library loaded by the process, you would need to import the libary and the process executable. </li>
  <li>remove binaries when a project is closed or deleted from the workspace</li>
  <li>remove  binaries  imported from outside the workspace by clicking the <b>Remove the selected executables</b> icon (<img src="images/icon_delete_launch_config.png" width="17" height="16" align="absmiddle">) or deleting the binary from the Executables project in the <a href="view_proj_explorer.htm">Project Explorer</a> view </li>
  <li>locate and manage which source and resource files are associated with each executable. Paths shown in black text have been resolved, those in gray text cannot be found. </li>
  <li>identify and correct any path issues with missing source files (shown in gray text). Double-click the missing source file to open a <b>Locate File</b> editor view which enables you to find the missing file. </li>
  <li>view routines and header files used by the source file. Click the tree control to expand or collapse a list of included header files and routine names for fast navigation. </li>
  <li>find and set breakpoints, watchpoints, and eventpoints in source files. Double-click a source file to open it in an editor view and to review the status of its breakpoints. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, an <b>Executables</b> project is created in the <a href="view_proj_explorer.htm">Project Explorer</a> view. The binaries shown in the Executables project can be deleted which also removes them from the Executables view. For binaries outside the workspace you must import them into the Executables view so their symbolics can be used during the debug session. <span class="note">You can also drag and drop executables into the view. </span></p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> To debug ROM DLLs with System TRK or in stop mode, always specify the <a href="../projects/launch/page_rom_log.htm">ROM Log file</a> in the project's launch configuration. </p>

        <li><b>Source File Location</b> - (default) The current location of the source file. If the path is shown in gray text the source file was not located.
