<h2>Auto-Targeting of Executables</h2>
<p>In run-mode  the Carbide debugger now supports the auto-targeting of processes that are already running or are created during the execution of the debug session. Previously, the debugger forced users to explicitly attach to a running process. Now, the debugger attempts to target all the EXEs specified in the <a href="../projects/launch/page_executables.htm">Executables</a> tab of the launch configuration. </p>
<ul>
  <li>If the executables are already started, it gets the load address of the executable and targets it for debugging, resolving any breakpoints it finds.</li>
  <li>The debugger will target any executable not already started whenever a &quot;process load&quot; event occurs, resolving its breakpoints as well.</li>
</ul>
