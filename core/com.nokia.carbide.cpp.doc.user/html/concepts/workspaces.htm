<h2>Workspace Information </h2>
<p>A workspace is the default place to store and create resources like projects, folders, and files. These are then presented to the user in a perspective which enables the presentation and manipulation of the stored resources.</p>
<p>When Carbide is launched it asks for a workspace to open (Figure 1). As you can have multiple workspaces, all independent from each other, choosing the workspace containing the projects to work on is important. Projects within a workspace are  shown in the Carbide workbench within the <a href="../debugger/variables/viewing_variables.htm">Project Explorer</a> and <a href="../reference/view_proj_explorer.htm">C/C++ Project</a> views. When you create a new project it is automatically added to the currently open workspace. You can import existing projects into a workspace from INF files.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 1. Workspace Launcher dialog</p>
<p class="note"><span class="style1">WARNING</span> Bld.inf imported projects are not copied, so do not delete the contents when deleting the project.</p>
<p>Projects in one workspace cannot refer to projects in a different workspace. Thus, large projects spanning  folders outside of the workspace are not handled at all. Storing all the project files in the workspace makes managing them   easier from a project management perspective. Files accessible inside the workspace, like project source and resource files, are better supported than those outside the workspace (for example, SDK headers). Local History, CVS, MMP/bld.inf editors, etc. are available for files inside the workspace but not for those outside the workspace. </p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> Carbide automatically updates MMP and INF files as changes are made within the MMP and INF editors.</p>
<p><span class="note">Carbide generates project support files, such as </span><span class="code">.project</span><span class="note"> and </span><span class="code">.cproject</span><span class="note"> and a </span><span class="code">.metadata</span><span class="note"> folder, which stores preferences.</span> Metadata files like &quot;.project&quot; are placed in the source tree. If adding these files to CVS causes a problem, these files may be excluded from CVS  using <b>Team &gt; Ignored Resources</b> preference panel to specify name patterns to exclude from version control.</p>
