<h2>Watchpoints Overview </h2>
<p>A <b>watchpoint</b> is a marker set on a specific memory location which is designed to suspend program execution when the value at that location changes. Watchpoints are closely related to breakpoints and are shown in the <a href="../reference/perspective_debug.htm">Breakpoints</a> view. </p>
<p>When a watchpoint is encountered during program execution, the debugger suspends execution and the <a href="../reference/perspective_debug.htm">Debug</a> perspective appears so you can examine the executable's current state,  check register and variable values, and use the stepping commands to walk line by line through the program to verify its operation. You can also change values and alter the flow of normal program execution. Setting watchpoints helps you debug your program and verify its efficiency.</p>
