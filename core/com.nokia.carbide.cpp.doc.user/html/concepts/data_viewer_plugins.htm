<h2>Data Viewer Plug-ins</h2>
<p>  Data Viewers are plug-ins that include an user interface to show a custom view of data. These plug-ins are often platform specific. Data editors are data viewers that also let you modify and write data.</p>
<p>The IDE will keep a registry of plug-ins that can view particular types. The plug-ins will register themselves with the IDE and indicate which formats and platforms they support. When a variable or memory address is selected, you can choose the plugin from the Data menu.</p>
<p>A Data Viewer plugin may also be designed without a custom user interface. This type of viewer would override the built in debugger methods of showing a variable value as text and parsing an edited value back into variable data.</p>
