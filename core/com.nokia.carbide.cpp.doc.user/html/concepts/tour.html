		Eclipse and the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT) provides a rich
		collection of views, editors, wizards and preference windows for performing C++
		development. The Symbian OS plug-ins for Eclipse extend this user interface so
		that you can perform the tasks involved in Symbian OS development from the
		Eclipse workbench, instead of needing to use the Symbian OS command-line
		toolchain. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>
		When you work with a Symbian OS C++ project, the workbench uses the <a href="CarbidePerspective.html">Carbide C/C++ perspective</a>, which will look
		something like this:</p> 
     <div class="Figure">

	 <p class="Image"><img src="images/workbench.png" width="815" height="638" /></p>
 
	 
</div> 
	 <p>
		For more information on the standard CDT views, refer to the C/C++
		Development Toolkit documentation. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>
		The Symbian OS plug-ins also add new wizards and editors. You can use
		these to: 
	 </p> 
 
	 <ul> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Create new Symbian OS projects using the New command, which is available on the File menu, and on the
		  pop-up menus of the C/C++ Projects and Navigator views.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/CreatingNewProjects.html">Creating New Projects</a>. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Import existing projects from Symbian OS bld.inf files using the Import command, which is
		  available on the File menu, and on the pop-up menus of the C/C++ Projects and Navigator views.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/ImportingProjects.html">Importing Projects from a Bld.Inf File</a>. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Add scalable graphics (MIF), Symbian OS bitmaps (MBM) and application information (AIF)
			 resources to projects, and edit these resources. You can add these using the		    New command, which is available on the File menu, and on the pop-up menus of the C/C++ Projects and Navigator views. MBM, MIF and AIF editors are provided to modify
		  the resources.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/Multi-BitmapFile.html">Creating an MBM File</a> and <a href="../tasks/AppInfoFile.html">Creating an AIF File</a>. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Build programs for multiple SDKs and targets. The standard CDT build
			 commands such as Build Project and Build All Configurations,
		  which are available in the Project menu, are used.</p> 
		  <p>
		  For more information, see <a href="../tasks/projects/prj_build.htm">Building Projects</a>.</p>
		</li> 
  </ul>

   
 

  <ul>
       <li> 
	     <p>
		    Configure the SDKs that are available for use with Carbide.c++ in the	       SDK Preferences settings. Select Window
         &gt; Preferences, expand the Carbide.c++ group and select SDK Preferences.</p>
