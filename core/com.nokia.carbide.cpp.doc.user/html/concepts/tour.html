		Eclipse and the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT) provides a rich
		collection of views, editors, wizards and preference windows for performing C++
		development. The Symbian plug-ins for Eclipse extend this user interface so
		that you can perform the tasks involved in Symbian development from the
		Eclipse workbench, instead of needing to use the Symbian command-line
		toolchain. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>
		When you work with a Symbian C++ project, the workbench uses the <a href="../projects/views/perspective_carbide.htm">Carbide C/C++ perspective</a>, which will look
		something like this:</p> 
     <div class="Figure">

	 <p class="Image"><img src="images/workbench.png" width="1028" height="789" /></p>
 
	 
</div> 
	 <p>
		For more information on the standard CDT views, refer to the C/C++
		Development Toolkit documentation. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>
		The Symbian plug-ins also add new wizards and editors. You can use
		these to: 
	 </p> 
 
	 <ul> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Create new Symbian projects using the New command, which is available on the File menu, and on the
		  pop-up menus of the <a href="../projects/views/view_proj_explorer.htm">Project Explorer</a> and <a href="../projects/views/view_sym_proj_nav.htm">Symbian Project Navigator</a> views.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/CreatingNewProjects.html">Creating New Projects</a>. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Import existing projects from Symbian bld.inf files using the Import command, which is
		  available on the File menu, and on the pop-up menus of the Project Explorer and Symbian Project Navigator views.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/ImportingProjects.html">Importing Projects from a Bld.Inf File</a>. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 Add scalable graphics (MIF) and Symbian bitmaps (MBM) to projects, and edit these resources. You can add these using the New command, which is available on the File menu, and on the pop-up menus of the Project Explorer and Symbian Project Navigator views. MBM and MIF editors are provided to modify
		  the resources.</p> 
		  <p>
			 For more information, see <a href="../tasks/Multi-BitmapFile.html">Creating an MBM File</a>.		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li>
        	<p>
            Build programs for multiple SDKs and targets. The standard CDT build commands such as Build Project and Build All Configurations,
		  which are available in the Project menu, are used.</p>
		    <p>
		  For more information, see <a href="../tasks/projects/prj_build.htm">Building Projects</a>.</p>
		</li> 
       <li>To view the SDKs that are available for use with Carbide.c++ use the <a href="../reference/pref_carb_symbian_sdk.htm">Symbian SDK</a> preferences panel. </li>
