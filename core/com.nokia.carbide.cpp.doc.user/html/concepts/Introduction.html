<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	 <p>
		The Symbian OS plug-ins for the Eclipse environment help provide support
		for developers to create and build C++ programs that run on Symbian OS. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>
		The plug-ins provide the following support to Symbian OS developers: 
	 </p> 
 
	 <ul> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 <b>Project Support</b>: developers can create new Symbian OS
			 projects  based on provided templates. Projects can also be
			 <a href="../tasks/ImportingProjects.html">imported</a> from the traditional <span class="ProgramOutput">bld.inf</span>  file formats. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 <b>Build Support</b>: The Symbian OS plug-ins eliminate the
			 need to use command line build tools to ease Symbian OS development.
			 Programs can be built and run from within the IDE. The developer can
			 also choose to build the binary automatically while saving the project. 
		  </p> 
		</li> 
		<li> 
		  <p>
			 <b>SDK Support</b>: users of the Carbide.c++  IDE can use a predefined series of <a href="../sos_references.htm">supported SDKs</a>. Developers can choose which of their
		  installed SDKs to work with for a particular project. </p> 
		</li> 
	 </ul>

	 <p>
		Documentation is available in the <b>C/C++ Development Toolkit User Guide</b> (CDT) for the  Symbian OS plug-ins that work with the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT). Programming for Symbian OS based platforms is described in the
		documentation supplied with the development kit that you use. Please consult
		that documentation for further information on Symbian OS concepts and
		development processes.</p>
