<h2>Emulation Debugging </h2>
<p>Symbian SDKs include an emulator that runs Symbian on a
  Microsoft Windows host computer. The emulator provides the full range of Symbian
  functionality, letting you do most development tasks on a single desktop computer. The 
  emulator and the software you build for it with the Carbide.c++ software run natively on the Intel x86 family of processors.</p>
<p> In many cases, you can build and debug a complete application using the emulator, then test the application on the actual device. There are cases however, where you cannot use
  the emulator, such as when developing device drivers that access hardware on a device.</p>
<p>For more information about the emulator, please see the documentation that came with
  your SDK under: <b>Developer Library &gt; Tools and Utilities &gt; Emulator</b>.</p>
<p> You will find an emulator to use with Carbide.c++  in:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="code">C:\Symbian\&lt;version&gt;\&lt;sdk&gt;\Epoc32\release\winscw\udeb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="code">Symbian</span> is the path containing the subdirectories and version number of the Symbian SDK.</p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> The first time you launch an emulator it may take some time to appear. Remember that it is implementing the operating system on the target device and that some setup time is required. </p>
