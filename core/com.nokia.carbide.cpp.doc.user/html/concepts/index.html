  <p>
	 This section of the User Guide provides an overview of the main concepts in
	 Eclipse to create and build programs for Symbian OS. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 The Symbian OS plug-ins are a set of Eclipse plug-ins that provide project,
	 SDK and build support for Symbian OS developers. The plug-ins extend the
	 functionality provided by Eclipse and the C/C++ Development Toolkit (CDT). 
  </p>
  <p>
	 The plug-ins simplify Symbian OS development by removing the need to use
	 command line build tools, and provide a graphical interface to Symbian OS
	 specific file formats, such as AIF and MBM. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 The plug-ins provide a new perspective, called the Carbide.c++ Perspective, on
	 the Eclipse workbench. This perspective enhances the standard CDT C/C++
	 perspective by allowing you to select easily the SDKs and build target types
	 that you want to use for each project.
  </p>
  <p>
	 The following topics discuss these concepts in more detail:
