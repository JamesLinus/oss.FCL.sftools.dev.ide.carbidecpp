<h2>Executables page </h2>
<p>The <b>Executables</b> page specifies the executables   available to debug with your project based on the chosen rule. The Executables page gives you project level control over the executables associated with it. The page shows all the executables in the workspace or those imported into the Executables view from outside the workspace that can be debugged by this project. See the <a href="../../reference/view_executables.htm">Executables</a> view for information on controlling  executables from the workspace. </p>
