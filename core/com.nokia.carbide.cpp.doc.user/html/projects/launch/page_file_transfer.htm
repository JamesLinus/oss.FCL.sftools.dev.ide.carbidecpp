<h2>File Transfer page</h2>
<p>The <b>File Transfer</b> page displays an auto-populated list of files for <a href="stop_mode.htm">System TRK</a> that the IDE transfers to the target device at the start of each launch. For RnD device images, the target location for files is normally <span class="code">c:\sys\bin</span> or another protected area. For production device images <a href="run_mode.htm">Application TRK</a> does not support the transfer of files to <span class="code">c:\sys\bin</span> or other protected areas.</p>
<p>Users can add, edit, or delete files in the list and sort   by clicking on a column header. By default, any file added is automatically checked for downloading to the device. Users can uncheck a file to remove it from the download list without removing the file itself. System TRK users can  use this panel to download any type of file, like bitmaps, HTML, sounds, and more, to the phone and applicable to Application TRK for transfering any files outside of the installation file.</p>

    <td><p>The File transfer list displays  the project files that are moved to the target device for launch and debugging purposes. It contains these columns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Enabled</b>&#8212;a checkmark indicates that the IDE should transfer the specified file to the target directory. If unchecked, do not transfer the file. </li>
        <li><b>File to transfer</b>&#8212;the path and filename to a file  on the host machine to be transfered </li>
        <li><b>Target directory</b>&#8212;the path to the target directory where transfered files are placed on the device.</li>
      </ul>      
      <blockquote>
        <p> The target directories where files can be installed depends upon the type of device image you have on the device and which version of TRK you are using.      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application TRK - public folders only on  production device images</li>
          <li>System TRK - public and protected folders, like <span class="code">c:\sys\bin</span>, on  RnD device images</li>
