<h2>Breakpoints Overview </h2>
<p>A <b>breakpoint</b> is a marker set on a specific line of source code and is designed to suspend program execution. Breakpoints are shown in the UI both with the associated source code in an editor view as well as a dedicated <a href="viewing_breakpoints.htm">Breakpoints</a> view. </p>
<p>When a breakpoint is encountered during program execution, the debugger suspends execution and the <a href="../../reference/perspective_debug.htm">Debug</a> perspective appears so you can examine the executable's current state,  check register and variable values, and use the stepping commands to walk line by line through the program to verify its operation. You can also change values and alter the flow of normal program execution. Setting breakpoints helps you debug your program and verify its efficiency.</p>
