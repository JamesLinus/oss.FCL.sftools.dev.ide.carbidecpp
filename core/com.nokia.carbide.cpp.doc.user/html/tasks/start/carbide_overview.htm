<h2>Carbide Overview</h2>
<p>Carbide is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed to develop <a href="http://www.SymbianFoundation.org">Symbian</a> applications for mobile devices. Carbide is built using the open source <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and C/C++ development toolkit (CDT) projects as its base with a wealth of additional tools that make it ideal for developing mobile applications. Carbide includes all the tools necessary to develop mobile applications including editors, GUI designers, project management tools, source code analysis tools, compilers, debuggers, profilers, on-device agents, revision control systems,and much more.</p>
<p>The basic structure of creating applications is easy to understand. You create a project, add some code, compile it into an executable file, then test it on an emulator, a simulator, or the actual device. If the application is compiled for debugging you can also control the program from within Carbide to ensure that the program behaves as expected using breakpoints, watchpoints, view variables, memory, stack traces, and other intimate details of the program as it runs.</p>
