<h2>Deploying Programs to Devices</h2>
<p>Once you have completed the program and tested it with the emulator, it&#8217;s possible to create a <a href="../projects/prj_new_build_config.htm">new</a> build configuration for your device, <a href="../projects/prj_build.htm">build</a> it, then create a <span class="code">.sis</span> file and deploy it to a device.</p>
<p>To upload a valid <span class="code">.sis</span> file to the target device you need software that communicates with the target device from your PC. Every Symbian phone ships with this connectivity software, which we will refer to generically as Symbian Connect. The actual name for the software is vendor dependent, so refer to your phone&rsquo;s documentation for the name.</p>
<p>For example, most phones from Nokia that use  Symbian OS  come with <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,72014,00.html">Nokia PC Suite</a>, which allows you to synchronize and transfer data between your compatible phone and a compatible PC via a compatible data cable or a wireless connection. </p>
<p> Essentially, the Symbian Connect program provides a method of connecting a PC to the target device via USB, IrDA, Bluetooth, or other serial connection. Once you make a connection, you can upload your <span class="code">.sis</span> file to the target device and install the program. </p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> A simple guide is provided to show the basic steps necessary to upload a .sis file to a target device. The actual steps required by the specific Symbian Connect program that ships with the SDK you are using may differ, so always refer to that phone &rsquo;s documentation for details.</p>
<div class="step">
  <h4>Deploying .sis Files</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Launch the phone&rsquo;s Symbian Connect program</li>
    <li>Select the method of connection</li>
    <p>In this step you select the form of the serial connection to use, USB, Irda, Bluetooth, etc.</p>
    <li>Select the .sis file to upload</li>
    <p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> Double-clicking the .sis file should launch the phone's Symbian Connect software.</p>
    <li>Upload the  .sis file using the Symbian Connect software </li>
    <li>Install the program on the target device</li>
  <p>To make the program available on the target device, you must install the program
    stored in the.sis file. Try double-clicking the .sis file on the phone to install it. If that doesn't work try selecting Install from the phone's menu,
    selecting the program name, then clicking Install.</p>
  </ol>
</div>
    <p>Congratulations, you&rsquo;ve now successfully uploaded a .sis file  to your
target device.</p>
