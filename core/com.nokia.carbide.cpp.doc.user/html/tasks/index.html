	 This section explains the different tasks that can be performed using the
	 Symbian OS plug-ins for Eclipse. It provides step-by-step instructions for
	 performing each task. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 To develop a program requires that you have installed one or more
	 development kits. The <i>Working with SDKs</i> tasks describes the
	 tasks for setting up and selecting the kits to use with your project. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 Next, program creation is described. This can be done either by creating a
	 new project through a wizard, or by importing an existing Symbian OS project
	 file. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 You can either import a 
	 <code class="filename">bld.inf</code> file, in which case all the projects specified in that
	 component are imported, or import a single 
	 <code>mmp</code> file. The two cases are discussed separately below. 
  </p>
  <p>
	 You can then add and build code in the project. This is mostly done using
	 the standard CDT tools and techniques. The plug-ins through also offer special
	 support for the Symbian OS specific file formats for application information
	 files (AIF) and multi-bitmap files (MBM), as described in <i>Modifying
	 Resources</i>.
