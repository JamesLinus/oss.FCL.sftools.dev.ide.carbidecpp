<h2>Installing On-device Debug Agents using PC Suite</h2>
<p>Use the PC Suite software that came with your device (<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4144905">Nokia PC Suite</a> is one example) to install the on-device debug agent, either Application TRK or System TRK, as a SISX file, to enable on-device debugging. Application TRK is usable on both consumer and RnD versions of the device. System TRK is only usable on RnD devices.</p>
<p>The installation location of the  on-device debug agent software varies based on the phone. On some phones  it will be the <b>Installed</b> folder, on others it may be in <b>My Own</b> folder. Refer to the documentation that came with the phone to learn where installed programs are stored. </p>
<p>Using PC Suite you can install any TRK debug agent on the device  using  a Bluetooth or USB connection. </p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> You can  use the connection software that came with your device to install the on-device debug agent SISX file. See your phone's operating manual for assistance on using it's software.</p>
