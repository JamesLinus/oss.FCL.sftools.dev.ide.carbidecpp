<h2>Setup a Virtual Drive (optional)</h2>
<p>SDKs have kernel components, kernel extensions and device drivers that are typically built on a virtual drive. So if you want to debug them the debugger will need to load files from the virtual drive that the binaries were built on. If you do not know the virtual drive the kit was built on you should first pick a drive letter randomly.</p>
<div class="step">
  <h4><a name="runVirDrive" id="runVirDrive"> </a>Setup a Virtual Drive for SDKs</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>To subst a drive, type on a command line:<br />
    &gt; subst <span class="question">drive_letter:</span> <span class="question">path_to_kit<br />
    </span>For example:<br />
&gt;<span class="code"> subst M: C:\Symbian\S60_5_0_201012</span></li>
    <li>On the command line type:<br />
&gt;<span class="code">subst</span><br />
    <p>You should see the new virtual drive pointing to your kit. If the debugger tries to load a file it can&rsquo;t find, it will look for it on the virtual drive. You can see this in the stack crawl. The stack crawl should give the full path of the file on the virtual drive the file was built on. The debugger will not be able to load the file until the correct virtual drive is specified.</p>
    <p>If this happens you can redo the virtual drive to use the drive specified in the stack crawl or navigate to the file using the existing virtual drive. From that point the IDE will add that path and recursively check folders for files it needs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure when you set up your default SDK in the Carbide IDE that you use the virtual drive.</li>
  </ol>
