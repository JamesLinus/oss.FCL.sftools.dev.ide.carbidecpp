<h2>Stepping Into a Routine</h2>
<p>Use the <b>Step Into</b> command (<img src="../../images/icons/btn_stepinto.png" width="18" height="14" />) to execute one source-code statement at a time and follow execution into a routine call.</p>
<p>When stepping through a program in a debug session the IDE attempts to match the program counter (PC) location in the executable with a known project source file. If there is no source file associated with the PC the debugger displays in the Debug view the current PC address of the thread (e.g. <span class="code">0x6002CC11(EUSER.DLL)()</span>) instead of the function name. At this point you can open the Disassembly view to step through the assembler code. This most commonly happens when trying to step into Symbian OS code. We recommend that you <a href="work_debug_act_stepover.htm">Step Return</a> out of the OS code and back into your project to continue debugging.<br />

  <h4>Stepping Into a Routine </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Click the Step Into button (<img src="../../images/icons/btn_stepinto.png" width="18" height="14" />) in the <a href="../../reference/view_debug.htm">Debug</a> view </li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>or</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Right-click the thread in the Debug view and select Step Into from the Debug contextual menu</li>
    <p>or</p>
	<li>Select Run &gt; Step Into from the  menu bar </li>
    <p>After the debugger executes the source-code statement, the current-statement arrow moves to the next statement determined by these rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the executed statement did not call a routine, the current-statement arrow moves to the next statement in the source code.</li>
      <li>If the executed statement called a routine, the current-statement arrow moves to the first statement in the called routine.</li>
      <li>If the executed statement is the last statement in a called routine, the current-statement arrow moves to the statement that follows the calling routine.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
