<h2>Adding Symbian Custom Kits</h2>
<p>The <span class="note">Carbide.c++ Developer Edition</span> and higher level products includes  functionality to work with Symbian CustKits or any arbitrary SDK source base. This enables you to work with evolving SDKs as they are released. </p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> The features that enable build support with CustKits are only available for Carbide.c++ Developer Edition and higher level products. </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Adding a CustKit without a devices.xml entry</b></li>
Use the <b>Add SDK</b> dialog to <a href="sdk_add.htm">add</a> an SDK entry for the CustKit that you want to use with the project. You may want to add a Symbian source base that Carbide.c++ can recognize if you do not plan to build from the command line. Once you've added the CustKit, you can now import projects against the newly added SDK.
<li><b>Mapping a CustKit</b><b> SDK to a known SDK release <br />
    <br />
  </b>Use the <a href="sdk_view_properties.htm">SDK Properties</a> window to map  an unrecognized SDK (S60_3rd_Ed_FP2) to a known version of  a similar SDK (S60_3rd_Ed) . This should enable you to import projects against the CustKit SDK. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><b>SDK Name</b> &#8212; templates and UI designs  may not display if the name used is not a known default  (e.g. com.nokia.s60) as defined under the SDK properties</li>
    <li><b>OS version</b> &#8212; ensure the correct OS version is assigned to the CustKit tells Carbide what platforms the SDK supports </li>
    <li><b>SDK version</b> &#8212;    used to filter which template projects and/or UI Designer projects are available and the UI components displayed </li>
  </ul>
