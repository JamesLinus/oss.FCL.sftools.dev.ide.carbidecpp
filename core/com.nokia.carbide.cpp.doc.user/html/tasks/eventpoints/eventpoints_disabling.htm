<h2>Disabling an Eventpoint</h2>
<p>Disable an eventpoint to prevent it from performing its specified action. The disabled eventpoint remains at the source-code line at which you set it, so that you can enable it later. Disabling the eventpoint is easier than clearing it and re-creating it from scratch.</p>
<div class="step">
  <h4>To disable an eventpoint</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the eventpoint to disable</li>
    <p>Select the eventpoint by name in the Breakpoints view, or click the cursor on the source-code line that contains the eventpoint.</p>
    <li>Click Debug &gt; Disable Eventpoint</li>
    <p>The Disable Eventpoint menu appears.</p>
    <li>From the menu, click the Disable Eventpoint command, where Eventpoint is the type of eventpoint that you want to disable</li>
    <p>The enabled eventpoint icon changes to a disabled eventpoint icon (shown at left). The disabled eventpoint icon indicates that the eventpoint does not perform its specified action.<br />
