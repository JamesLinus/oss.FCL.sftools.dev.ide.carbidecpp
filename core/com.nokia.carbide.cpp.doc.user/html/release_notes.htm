<h2>Carbide.c++ Release Notes 3.0.0</h2>
<p>The Carbide.c++  is a comprehensive development tool suite for Symbian OS that is based on the Eclipse framework. The C++ Development Toolkit (CDT), provides the foundation for project and build tools management, as well as the primary interface for the debugger to communicate with the IDE. </p>
<p>This is a collection of important information concerning last-minute
  changes and other topics that deserve special attention.&nbsp;Please
  read these notes carefully before using the Carbide tools so you
  understand the current limitations and workarounds for known
  issues. </p>

Updating the CDT feature in Carbide.c++/Eclipse will wipe out our
changes making the tools unusable!</p>

<h3><a name="whatsNew" id="whatsNew"></a>What's New in 3.0.0 </h3>
<p>The following features for Symbian  development are provided within Carbide.c++:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Nada </b> supported &mdash; ???</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="new260" id="new260"></a>2.6.0 </h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>GCCE 4.0 </b> supported &mdash; required for future SBSv2 releases.</li>
    <li><b>Symbian^3 </b>supported &mdash; new templates and improvements required for the public Symbian^3 SDK.</li>
    <li><b>Known Issues in v2.6.0</b>:
        <ul>
                <li>GCCE4 support requires using a SBSv2 build alias (<span class="code">-c</span> parameter) of <span class="code">armv5_udeb_gcce</span> or <span class="code">armv5_urel_gcce</span>. As of this writing, these aliases were not available in the SDK or SBSv2, but will appear in some future version. Carbide versions prior to 2.6 do not support GCCE4.</li>
            <li>Users should consult the SDK documentation for GCCE and SBSv2 issues and installation requirements.</li>
            <li>TRK: If you install the TRK app onto your phone's flash memory (Mass Storage) a Remote Connection may not find the TRK-service even though TRK is already connected to your PC.         Workaround: Uninstall TRK then reinstall it onto your PHONE memory (C-drive). The TRK service should now be &quot;Available&quot;.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="new250" id="new"></a>2.5.0</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Plug-and-Play (PnP) On-device Debugging </b> supported &mdash; debugging a target device just got easier. Using a USB cable, connect the PC to the target device, then launch Carbide.c++. Carbide locates the connected device and creates a remote connection setup to communicate with it. Build the program and launch it on the device to start the debugging session. Refer to <a href="#pnpIssues">Known PnP Issues</a> for details if you experience problems.</li>
  <li><b>PnP Phone Launch Wizard</b> - If the project does not already have a launch configuration, the PnP Launch Wizard makes it easy to create one for <a href="projects/launch/launch_phone.htm">phones</a>. In addition the new <a href="projects/launch/wnd_config_launch_config.htm">Configure Launch Configuration</a> dialog provides a quick summary of the remote connection for easy review and modification.</li>
  <li><b>Carbide  automatically detects TRK on target phones and devices</b> - Carbide  now detects the presence of either Application or System TRK on a connected device when TRK 3.2.6 or later are installed. Earlier TRK versions  do not support this recognition feature.</li>
  <li><b>TRK improvements</b> - TRK continues to evolve and now includes these improvements:
    <ul>
        <li>Both Application and System TRK v3.2.6 support PnP debugging. Update and install  using the <b>Help &gt; On Device Connections &gt; Install Remote Agents</b> pane in the <b>New Connection</b> dialog.</li>
      <li><span class="code">VERSION3</span> command now supported</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>RVCT 4.0 (ARMv5)</b> builds and some limited debugging is supported</li>
  <li><b>Symbian ^3 SDK</b> now supported</li>
</ul>

If you need to import copies of existing files (File &gt; Import &gt; File System) or link to existing sources (File &gt; New &gt; Folder with &quot;Link to folder in file system&quot;), then a normal folder will be created, not a source folder.

If you edit the <span class="code">DEF</span> filename through the MMP editor, it is not automatically conditioned for the current target. If you wish to define target-specific <span class="code">DEF</span> file names in the MMP editor, manually insert <span class="code">#ifdef...#endif</span> blocks, or first uncomment the <span class="code">#ifdef...#endif</span> block from the template, so that target-specific filenames will be properly updated.</td>

Sometimes the emulator is slow to release its own handles to files after quitting an application. If a file is still locked on a rebuild make sure the application is closed (not the emulator itself), wait a few seconds, and try again. </p>
      <p> 2) When setting breakpoints in source files that have been recompiled they do not always resolve correctly while the emulator is running. The best option is to clear the breakpoints in any modified file and set them again.</p></td>
