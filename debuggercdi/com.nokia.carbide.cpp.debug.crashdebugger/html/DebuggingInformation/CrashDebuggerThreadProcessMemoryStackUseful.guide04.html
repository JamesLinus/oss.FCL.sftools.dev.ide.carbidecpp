  <h2>Thread and Process Exit Information Summary</h2>
</div><div>
<p>
User threads and processes have &#8220;exit information&#8221;. When a thread or
process terminates the reason for the termination is found in the exit
information. For example, a panic will store the panic category and reason in
the exit information. Exit information has three parts: the exit type, exit
reason and exit category. 
</p>
<p>
Exit type is defined by the TExitType enum. 
</p>
<p>
When a thread or process is created, its exit type is set to 3. An exit
type of 3 indicates that the thread is still active, though not necessarily
running. If the thread terminates for any reason, then the exit type is changed
to reflect the cause of the exit. 
</p>
<p>
Once the thread or process has exited, the exit reason and exit type
fields will contain useful information. The contents depends on the type of
exit. 
</p>
<p>
Note that if the main thread in a process exits, then the process will
exit with the same exit information as the thread. 
</p>

<div class="Head3">
<h3><span class="Bodytext"><a name="1.6.8"></a></span>Exit category: Terminate</h3>
</div><div>
<p>
if RThread::Terminate() or RProcess::Terminate() is called, then the exit category is
Terminate, and the exit reason is the value of the
aReason argument passed to these functions. 
</p>

<div class="Head3">
<h3><span class="Bodytext"><a name="1.6.9"></a></span>Exit category: Kill</h3>
</div><div>
<p>
If RThread::Kill() or RProcess::Kill() is called, then the exit category is
Kill, and the exit reason is the value of the aReason
argument passed to these functions. 
</p>

</div>
<div class="Head3">
<h3><span class="Bodytext"><a name="1.6.10"></a></span>Exit category: panic</h3>
</div><div>
<p>
If a thread panics, then the exit category is panic, and
the exit reason is the panic number. For example a USER-19 panic would give the
following exit information: 
</p>
<p class="listing">exit type = 2<br>
  exit category = “USER”<br>exit reason = 19</p>
