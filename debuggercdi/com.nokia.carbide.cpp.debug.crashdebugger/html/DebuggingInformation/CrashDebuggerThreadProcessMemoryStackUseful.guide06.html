<h2>Kernel Calls and Thread Context</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
When a user thread makes a call into any kernel code, the kernel code
continues to run in the context of the user thread. This applies to device
driver code. 
</p>
<p>
The stack is swapped to a kernel-side stack and the permissions of the
thread are increased to kernel privilege, but otherwise the user thread is
still running. Each thread has a small kernel stack used to handle kernel calls
&#8211; it would be dangerous to continue using the normal thread stack in case it
overflows. Some calls are handled in this state, others&#0160;&#8211;  typically device
drivers&#0160;&#8211;  will post a message to a kernel side thread to carry out the request.
