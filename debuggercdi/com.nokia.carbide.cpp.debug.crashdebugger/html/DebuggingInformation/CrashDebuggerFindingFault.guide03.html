<h2>Panics</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>If the <em>Fault Category</em> is not <em>Exception</em>,
then the fault is due to a panic. In this case the only other valid field is
the <em>Fault reason</em>; the values of all other fields are
meaningless.</p>
<p> The panic number is the low 16-bits of the fault reason, shown in
hexadecimal.</p>
<p>For example, a KERN 27 panic would generate:</p>
<p class="listing">Fault Category: KERN  Fault Reason: 0000001b<br>
  ExcId ffffee5e CodeAddr ffff99a9 DataAddr bfff3e54 Extra fffec4cd</p>
<p>If the panic is KERN 4, then a thread or process marked as
protected has panicked. For other panics, kernel side code has panicked; this
code is either in the kernel itself or in a device driver.</p>
<p>See <a href="CrashDebuggerInfoAboutKernel.guide.html">Extracting information about the kernel</a> to find out which process and thread were
running at the time of the panic.</p>
