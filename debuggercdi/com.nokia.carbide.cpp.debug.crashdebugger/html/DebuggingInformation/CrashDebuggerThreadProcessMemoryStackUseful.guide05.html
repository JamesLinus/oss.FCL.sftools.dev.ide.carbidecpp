<h2>Critical Threads and Processes</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
Marking a thread or process as &#8220;system critical&#8221; means that it is an
integral and essential part of the system, for example, the file server. In
effect the thread or process is being declared necessary for correct
functioning of the device. If a system critical thread exits or panics then the
device will reboot; during development it will enter the debug monitor. A
thread can be set as process critical, which means that if it panics the
process will be panicked.
