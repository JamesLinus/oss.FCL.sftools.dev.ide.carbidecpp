<h2>Virtual Memory and Run Addresses</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>
Symbian OS devices have an MMU which is used to map the addresses seen
by running code to real addresses of memory and I/O. The MMU in effect creates
a virtual memory map, allowing scattered blocks of RAM to appear contiguous, or
for a section of memory to appear at different addresses in different
processes, or not at all. 
</p>
<p>
Symbian OS uses the MMU to provide memory protection between processes,
to allow sharing of memory, efficient allocation of RAM and to make all
processes &#8220;see&#8221; the same memory layout. Three different memory models are
supported by Symbian OS on ARM CPUs: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
moving model: this is the model familiar from EKA1 where processes
are moved to a run-address in low memory when executing and moved back to a
home-address in high memory when not running. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
direct model: this is used when the CPU does not have an MMU, or is
emulating a system without an MMU. Not normally used, but occasionally useful
for development boards 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
multiple model: only supported in ARM architecture V6 and above,
each process has its own set of MMU tables. A context switch changes the
current MMU table to the new thread&#8217;s table, instead of moving memory about in
a single table as with moving model. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="Bodytext"><a name="1.10.6"></a></span>Fixed processes</h3>
</div><div>
<p>
For ARM architectures with a virtually-tagged cache, fixed processes
avoid the need to flush the cache on context switches by keeping all the code
and data at a fixed address. This implies that there can only ever be one
instance of each fixed process because the data chunk address cannot be
changed. 
</p>
<p>
Important servers such as the file server and window server are
fixed. 
</p>
<p>
There is no limit to the number of fixed processes that can be
supported. The kernel will attempt to use ARM domains for fixed process
protection, but there are a limited number of domains so when they are
exhausted normal MMU techniques will be used. Domains are slightly faster in a
context switch but this is negligible compared to the real purpose of the fixed
process in avoiding the cache flush.
