<h2>Custom Components</h2>

<p> The UI Designer has built-in support for the standard S60 UI components. The standard components perform the most commonly needed user interface tasks. If your application requires custom components and you define them properly you can create and edit them within the UI Designer. User defined components may show up in any palette category, but by default they will appear under <strong>User components</strong>.</p>
<p>A component is defined by an identifier (a unique string, such as the C++ class name), a version string indicating the revision of the component, and an SDK filter. The SDK filter allows a component to be used with all SDKs, SDKs with a particular name, SDKs with a specific version or range of versions, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>Each top-level directory may contain one or more files of the form *.sdkinfo, which imposes additional filtering constraints on the entire set of components based on the selected component SDK name and version. User component projects are installed when opened in a workspace.</p>
