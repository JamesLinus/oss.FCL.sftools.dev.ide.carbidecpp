<h2>Symbian OS UI</h2>

<p>The starting point for developing applications for Symbian OS is to obtain a software development kit (SDK). SDKs for Symbian OS support development in both C++ and Java. They provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  Binaries and tools to facilitate building and deployment of Symbian OS applications</li>
  <li>Full system documentation for APIs and tools</li>
  <li> PC-based emulation of Symbian OS phones</li>
  <li>Example applications with supporting documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>SDKs are in practice built based on a particular UI platform for Symbian OS. A UI platform provides a distinct UI and an associated set of system applications for such tasks as messaging, browsing, telephony, multimedia and contact/calendar management. These applications typically make use of generic application engines provided by Symbian OS. UI platforms intended to support the installation of third-party applications written in native C++ have to be supported by an SDK which defines that UI platform, or at least a particular version of it.</p>
<p>For the independent software developer, the most important thing to know in targeting a particular phone is the associated UI platform. Next you need to know the Symbian OS version the phone was based on. This combined knowledge defines  the target phone as a platform for independent software development. You can then decide which SDK you need to obtain. In most cases you will be able to develop a single version of your application that targets all phones based on the same UI platform and Symbian OS version.</p>
