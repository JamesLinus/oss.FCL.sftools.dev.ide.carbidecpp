<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Carbide.c++ UI Designer allows the developer to easily create and modify 
the user interface for a phone application.</p>
<p>A graphic design screen allows the developer to add, modify, and arrange 
elements for one or more UI designs, menus, and other standard or custom UI 
elements. The tool enforces design conventions while allowing the developer to 
quickly create a well designed interface which contains multiple UI designs.</p>
<p>A wizard is provided which leads the developer through all of the steps necessary to add new UI designs to her/his application.</p>
<p>Developers drag components from a provided palette of standard interface elements to populate their UI designs with objects of the component types. Objects may be edited, moved, aligned, and deleted at will. </p>
<p>Developers may create custom components and add them to their design 
environment. Once added, the custom components will appear on the component 
palette and may be created, modified, and/or deleted as any other component.</p>
<p>The UI Design tool tracks the design decisions made by the developer in creating and populating UI designs. The information is used by the tool to create  files and subsections of files which define the desired user interface to the SDK and C++ compiler.</p>
<p> The files and file subsets which are created and updated automatically by the UI Design tool are  framed with explanatory comments in the associated source files. These comments indicate the degree of ownership which the design tool claims over each section of the generated files. Manual edits within regions which are marked &quot;Do Not Modify&quot; are subject to being over-written without warning by the UI Design tool during a subsequent edit session. </p>
