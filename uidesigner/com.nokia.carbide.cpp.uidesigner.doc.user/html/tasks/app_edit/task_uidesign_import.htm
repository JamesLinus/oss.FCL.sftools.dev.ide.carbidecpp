<h2>Importing a UI Design</h2>

<p>When you create a UI design with the UI Designer it is automatically included in the builds of the project to which you originally assign it. If you decide that you do not want that UI Design to be part of your project, you may permanently <a href="../uidesign/task_uid_delete.htm">delete it</a> or temporarily <a href="task_uidesign_remove.htm">remove it</a> from the project. </p>
<p>Later, if you wish to restore a UI Design which you have temporarily removed - or if you wish to<a href="../uidesign/task_uid_copy_in.htm"> copy</a> a UI design originally created for a different project into your project - you must import the UI design into the project for it to be included with subsequent builds.</p>
