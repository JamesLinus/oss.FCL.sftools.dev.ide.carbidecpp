<h2>Reordering UI Designs</h2>

<p>The <a href="../../reference/app_editor/ref_ui_design.htm">UI Designs</a> page of the Application Editor displays all UI Designs within your project in the order they will appear in the tab group. You may specify the tab group order for each UI Design by changing its placement in this list. </p>
<div class="step">
