<h2>Selecting Images</h2>

<p>The <a href="../../reference/views/ref_edit_image_property.htm">Edit Image Property</a> or <a href="../../reference/views/ref_edit_multiimage_property.htm">Edit Multi-Image Property</a> dialog allows you to select any multi-image file (MBM or MIF) contained within the project and view the images it contains. It allows you to assign any image contained within the selected multi-image file to any graphic object in your application.</p>
<div class="step">

	<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> Bitmaps or Icons added to the project will be assigned to the selected Multi-Image File. </p>

	<li>[Optional] Click the Edit MBM/MIF File... button if the desired image is not in any of the available multi-image files.</li>
	<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> This step is not necessary if the multi-image file  contains the image you wish to assign.</p>
