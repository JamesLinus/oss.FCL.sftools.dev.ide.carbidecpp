<h2>Tutorial: Yahoo! Image Search</h2>
<p>This example shows how to use the Carbide.c++ UI Designer for S60 to 
define the UI of an application and to implement the "real work" in the 
generated code. </p>
<p>The application consists of two screens. The main screen prompts the user to to initiate a search and 
displays the list of search results. The second screen displays the Yahoo! provided thumbnail image of
the selected result.

<h3><font size="4">Using the S60 UI Designer to create the UI</font></h3>
<p>The initial project was created using the "C++ Application for S60" wizard with
the "S60 3rd Ed. GUI Application with UI Designer" template.
</p>

<p>Since the main screen for this application is the search results, this was
the initially created view. Both the results view and the image view were 
created using the Avkon view switching architecture. Since the UI designer defaults to using the 
view switching architecture nothing needs to be done to enable it. The view switching architecture was used
because it simplifies the work our application has to do, and in particular it make it easy to have distinct
control and status panes for each of our screens.
</p>
<p>The user interface definition for the search results view is in SearchResults.uidesign. 
Open it in the UI Designer.
</p>
<p>When the Avkon view switching architecture is used the UI Design creates two separate C++ classes.
A subclass of CAknView is the controller of the UI. It is referenced by the AppUi and
is responsible for creating the user interface and handling commands. The other class
is the actual UI container and varies based on the type of design. In this case it
derives directly from CCoeControl and contains the CAknDoubleStyleListBox used here.
</p>
<p>List boxes may be populated at design time with list item objects. This 
application does not use them because we populated the list dynamically based
on the search results. The UI Designer displays the generic "no data" text rather than
our custom "Start a search..." prompt because this was implemented using custom code
in the CSearchResultsView::PopulateSearchResultsL() method.
</p>
<p>In addition to the status pane, list box, and control pane, this design 
uses several non-layout objects.</p>
<div align="center">
  <p><img src="nonlayout.jpg"/>
</p>
  <p class="figure">Figure 1 - Non-layout objects used by example </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>optionsMenu - this is a menu bar object, and is a container for menu panes
and menu items. Clicking on it displays the menu editor.
</li>
<li>webClient - this is an object implementing HTTP GET. It optionally handles interaction with
a wait dialog to handle progress display and a query dialog to prompt for user names and passwords. In this 
example we use the wait dialog but have no need for authentication.
</li>
<li>waitDialog - the wait dialog object used with the webClient. Click on it to edit.
</li>
<li>searchPrompt - the query dialog used to get a search string from the user. Click on it to edit.
</li>
<li>attribution - a note object used to display a credit for Yahoo! web services. Click on it to edit.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The user interface definition for the image display view is in ImageContainer. 
Open it in the UI Designer.
</p>
<p>This is a very simple view, containing only an image object. As with the list box, all
our data is determined at run time, so we do not define any image information at
design time. We've configured the control pane with just a Back button. 
</p>
<p>The title pane text is just a placeholder. It is populated with the image file
name at run time, in the CImageContainerView::DoActivateL method.
