<h2>Tutorial: Yahoo! Image Search</h2>
<p>This example shows how to use the Carbide.c++ UI Designer for S60 to 
define the UI of an application and to implement the "real work" in the 
generated code. </p>
<p>The application consists of two screens. The main screen prompts the user to to initiate a search and 
displays the list of search results. The second screen displays the Yahoo! provided thumbnail image of
the selected result.

<h3><font size="4">Using the WebClient component to retrieve XML data</font></h3>

<p>The WebClient component is a non-UI object that implements HTTP GET requests.
</p>
<p>Since web requests can take a bit of time to complete, they are not handled
synchronously, i.e. as simple function calls. Rather, a function call is made to
initiate a request. That function call returns immediately. Callbacks are made to 
notify the caller of the ongoing progress of the request and to signal completion.
</p>
<p>The web client component uses the MWebClientObserver callback interface to make
callbacks to the client. The UI Designer then layers a set of component events on 
top of that interface, delivering notifications to application-defined handler functions
for selected events.

<p class="figure">Figure 2 - Events view showing event handlers </p>
<p>Because this application is handling HTTP in a very simple way, we only respond to events
in order to collect the incoming HTTP data, and to receive notification when the request
is complete. You can view the event information by selecting the webClient instance  (Figure 1) , right-clicking
and choosing "Show Events View".  The handled events have handler function names in the right-hand
column (Figure 2).

<p>Details of the Yahoo! Image Search API may be found at 
<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/image/V1/imageSearch.html">http://developer.yahoo.com/search/image/V1/imageSearch.html.</a>
In brief, it uses a REST-style query API and returns results as XML. In this example, we use the
CYahooSearchModel class to encapsulate XML parsing logic and maintaining the list of results.
This class has no user interface and was manually written. It provides an example of separating application
specific data handling, showing how it may be kept separate from the user interface portion of the application.</p>
<p>On the next page, we will show how all these components are put together to create the application.</p>
