<h2>Tutorial: Birthdays - Persistent Storage </h2>
<P>This example shows how to use the Carbide.c++ UI Designer for S60 to define the UI of an application and to implement the "real work" in the generated code. </P>
<P>The goals of the application are to:</P>
<UL>

    <P><a href="BirthdaysTutorial_02.html">Maintain data and UI separation</a></P>

  </UL>
<h3>Persistent Storage</h3>
<P>The document class (<span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span>) contains the necessary
overrides to stream the data to and from disk. 
</P>
<P><B>Note</B>: most S60 documentation claims that the document
class, inherited from Symbian OS, is deprecated. Probably for the
uses of most advanced applications, which need more than a single
file, this is true. Our example uses the file loading/storing
capabilities of this class for didactic brevity. Probably an advanced
application would use a more elaborate mechanism to manage this data.</P>
<P>S60's <span class="code">CAknDocument</span> class turns off support for automatically
loading the document when the program starts; we derive our document
from <span class="code">CEikDocument</span> to work around this. The document is persisted to a
location automatically determined by the application UID and the
first <span class="code">TBUF{}</span> 
struct in <span class="code">&lt;project&gt;.rss</span>. On my system it's
"<span class="code">C:\Symbian\9.1\S60_3rd\Epoc32\winscw\c\private\010ae5b3\Birthdays</span>".</P>
<P>We overload the <span class="code">StoreL()</span> and 
<span class="code">RestoreL()</span> methods of <span class="code">CEikDocument</span> to
handle saving and loading. These establish a stream store and a
dictionary on that store. We use the application UID to identify the
data we are storing or retrieving, then stream out the document into
the store.</P>
<P>We store the birthdays as binary streams using <span class="code">RWriteStream</span> and
<span class="code">RReadStream</span>. The <span class="code">InternalizeL()</span> and 
<span class="code">ExternalizeL()</span> methods provided
on <span class="code">TBirthday</span> and <span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> are the entry points for this
streaming.</p>
<p>
Note that these are not part of an interface or virtual
function overloads; instead, they are referenced by the template
"<span class="code">operator &lt;&lt; (RReadStream&amp;, T&amp;)</span>" and
"<span class="code">operator &gt;&gt; (RWriteStream&amp;, const T&amp;)</span>"
methods. 
</P>
<P>Given the use of <span class="code">CEikDocument</span>, loading of the birthdays list
through <span class="code">RestoreL()</span> is automatic, though saving is still manual.
Whenever the list modifies a birthday, it invokes the document's
<span class="code">SaveL()</span> method to ensure the latest changes are persisted.</P>
