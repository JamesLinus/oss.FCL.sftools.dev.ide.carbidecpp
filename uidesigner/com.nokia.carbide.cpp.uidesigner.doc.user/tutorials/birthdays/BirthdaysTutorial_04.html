<h2>Tutorial: Birthdays - Adding Application Logic</h2>
<P>This example shows how to use the Carbide.c++ UI Designer for S60 to define the UI of an application and to implement the "real work" in the generated code. </P>
<P>The goals of the application are to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
    <P><a href="BirthdaysTutorial_02.html">Maintain data and UI separation</a></P>
  <LI>
    <P><a href="BirthdaysTutorial_03.html">Use the S60 UI Designer to create the UI</a></P>
  <LI>
    <P><b>Editing generated source to provide application logic</b></P>
  <LI>
    <P><a href="BirthdaysTutorial_05.html">Save and restore birthdays from persistent storage</a></P>
  <LI><a href="BirthdaysTutorial_06.html">Summary </a>
  </UL>
<H3>Adding application logic</H3>
<P>As created, the application would show an empty list box and allow
exiting, but not much else. We need to populate the list, handle the
items on the Options menu, and bring up the form to add and edit
birthdays.</P>
<H4>Editing generated source</H4>
<P>The S60 UI Designer provides the bulk of the source code. We only
need to add event handlers and data management code. 
</P>
<P>In the generated C/C++ sources, commented regions indicate where
the designer "owns" code:</P>
<pre>
/**
 * Second-phase constructor for view.
 * Initialize contents from resource.
 */
void CBirthdaysListView::ConstructL()
	{
	// [[[ begin generated region: do not modify [Generated Code]
	BaseConstructL( R_BIRTHDAYS_LIST_BIRTHDAYS_LIST_VIEW_2 );
	// ]]] end generated region [Generated Code]
	}
</font></pre>
<P>The "begin generated region" and "end generated
region" comments surround code the designer will rewrite on
each save. The source generation was designed to allow you to edit
code that requires an override of S60 APIs, so you may add lines
before the "begin" comment or after the "end"
comment as needed. (Hint: if you totally dislike the generated code,
you can put "<span class="code">if (0) {</span>" before, and "<span class="code">}</span>"
after!)</P>
<P>You may edit anything else in the generated files, including
reordering methods and moving sections containing generated code. The
only caveats are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>don't edit inside the "generated" comments</P>
	<LI><P>don't change the "generated" comments, except
	perhaps to indent them differently</P>
	<LI><P>don't rename generated files, classes, enums, methods, etc.</P>
	<LI><P>don't change the hierarchy of generated code (for example,
	leave methods in their original class; don't move them to a subclass
	or inner class).</P>
</UL>
<P>If you violate these constraints, the original code will be
replaced on the next save, sometimes with a lot of warnings.</P>
<P>In resources, there are no "generated" comments
because the UI Designer can fully reparse RSS. At this time, however,
its restrictions are a lot like C++:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>don't modify generated fields (they will be replaced on the
	next save)</P>
	<LI><P>don't rename generated files or resources</P>
	<LI><P>don't change the hierarchy of resources (for example, moving
	a resource expression into a standalone resource)</P>
</UL>
<P>You may, however, add new fields to generated resources and add
new resources, #includes, etc. Also, you may modify the contents of
generated <span class="code">*.loc</span> / <span class="code">*.l<I>xx</I></span> / <span class="code">*.rls</span> files. Here, if you edit
strings, and they will be propagated back into the design (when it is
open). This requires a new save of the design to synchronize the
changes.</P>
<H4>Creating list items</H4>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">In the design, the list is empty and
shows "No data". At runtime, however, it will be
populated dynamically by reading entries from disk and adding entries
interactively. 
</P>
<P>In S60, a list box owns a list box model, which provides the
content. This list box model is populated with one string per row,
with fields separated by tabs. The list box style directly determines
the format of this string. Typically, if you scan top to bottom, then
left to right, this spells out the fields. In our "Double
Large" style, the fields are (1) icon index, (2) top-right
text, and (3) bottom-right text.</P>
<P>The UI Designer creates utility functions for list item formatting
based on the current style. See
"<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::CreateListBoxItemL()</span>" for populating a
TBuf&lt;&gt; with the items making up a row, and
"<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::AddListBoxItemL()</span>" for adding that
string as an item to the list box. 
</P>
<P>Side note: "<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::AddResourceArrayItemL()</span>"
combines these two for the purpose of creating list box items from an
ARRAY resource (where each element is one field of the item,
excluding any image index, which is specified at runtime as the final
argument). This is used when List Items are added at design time.</P>
<H4>List item images</H4>
<P>The left-hand column shows an icon, which is a gift box, and
changes to a gift box with an exclamation mark when a person's
birthday is within a week. (Have you bought a present?)</P>
<P>In S60, images are added to a list in an indirect fashion. A list
box has an array of icons associated with it, and list items refer to
these icons by index. For instance, if the first field of an item is
the image, and the second image in the icon array is used, the text
for the item may read "<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">1\tName\tDate"</FONT>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">(images being indexed starting at
0)</FONT>. 
</P>
<P>When constructing a list box with prepopulated items, images are
specified by editing the "image" property of a list item.
For dynamically-added list items, you may specify additional images
in the list box's "additional images" array. The UI
Designer automatically sets up the list box's icon array for you and
provides an enumerator for accessing each image in a TListBoxImages
enumeration in the list box container class. You may use these
enumerators, for instance, in the
"<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::CreateListBoxItemL()</span>" call to specify
the image index.</P>
<P>If this is still insufficient for your needs, you may edit the
generated <span class="code">SetupListBoxIconsL()</span> method and add more images to the end,
after the generated code section. The indices for these images would
start from <span class="code">E&lt;listbox&gt;FirstUserImageIndex</span>. 
</P>
<H4>List box and birthdays list model interaction</H4>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The list box as defined in S60
contains a "listbox model" which is the array of
tab-delimited strings defining the cells in a list item (as described
in "Creating List Items"). This model reflects the
contents of the birthdays list, which is an array of <span class="code">TBirthday</span>
managed by the <span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> class. The listbox model is
synchronized with the birthdays document whenever a user action
constitutes a change. This requires explicit synchronization in this
application. A more advanced program would probably add a listener
model to the <span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> class so the list could react to
changes it hasn't caused itself.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">An important limitation of this
program is that the indices are identical between the
<span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> and the listbox model. There is no separation
here, so when elements are added, removed, or edited in the listbox,
we use the same index for two different models. If you were to add
sorting to the list, for instance, you would need to sort the
<span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> model too.</P>
<H4>Events</H4>
<P>The list box is pretty much inert without handling events. We add
events both to the <b>Options</b> menu and to the List box. The "Events"
view shows, for the currently selected item(s), the available events
and which ones have handlers. (Use the context menu item "Show
Events View" if you don't see this view.)</P>
<P align="center"><img src="birthdays_events_view.png" width="537" height="167"></P>
<P class="figure">Figure 1 - Events view properties </P>
<P align="left">The <b>Options</b> menu contains the primary commands for manipulating
  the list. For each menu item, we use the context menu's "<b>Handle
  'selected' event</b>" to establish a handler for the menu item.
  (Once an event is bound, this command changes to "<b>Go to
'selected' handler code</b>".) </P>
<P>Note: this context menu shortcut is used for the one most common
event on the selected object, if any; you will usually find more in
the Events view.</P>
<P>We set up events for the items in the Options menu. When binding
an event, the handler function is named after the menu item (which
itself is named after the initial text you enter). If you want to
change the function, type a new name in the "Function"
column of the Events view. Note that doing this merely adds a new
empty function with the given name; any existing function will not be
renamed.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Add</B>: 
	</P>
	<P>The "selected" event handler attached to this item
	("<span class="code">CBirthdaysListView::HandleAddMenuItemSelectedL()</span>")
	invokes the Edit Birthday form (see below).</P>
	<LI><P><B>Edit</B>: 
	</P>
	<P>The "selected" event handler attached to this item
	("<span class="code">CBirthdaysListView::HandleEditMenuItemSelectedL()</span>")
	invokes the Edit Birthday form (see below).</P>
	<LI><P><B>Mark/unmark</B>: 
	</P>
	<P>The items in this menu are automatically handled as part of a
	markable list. If the menu were used elsewhere, you would need
	explicit handler code for the <span class="code">EAknCmdMark</span>, 
	<span class="code">EAknCmdUnmark</span>,
	<span class="code">EAknMarkAll</span>, and 
	<span class="code">EAknUnmarkAll</span> commands.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Delete</B>: 
	</P>
	<P>The "selected" event handler attached to this item
	("<span class="code">CBirthdaysListView::HandleDeleteMenuItemSelectedL()</span>")
	invokes the confirmation query asking the user to confirm such a
	terrible idea. The method
	"<span class="code">CBirthdaysListView::RunRemoveConfQueryL()</span>" is
	automatically generated for this purpose. You may override the
	prompt text, if needed (e.g. to show a detailed report about how
	many birthdays will be lost). 
	</P>
	<P>If the user agrees, the items are deleted from the list. A static
	method is provided in the generated list box container for this
	purpose ("<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::DeleteSelectedListBoxItemsL()</span>"),
	which handles the intricacies of deleting multiple items in a list.</P>
</UL>
<P>The Avkon view's "deactivated" event is bound to a
function "<span class="code">CBirthdaysListView::HandleBirthdaysListViewDeactivated()</span>"
that saves the birthdays document. (The document is also saved after
every edit.)</P>
<P>The list box's "enterKeyPressed" event is bound to a
function "<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::HandleListBoxEnterKeyPressedL()</span>"
that edits the current birthday, just like the "Options / Edit"
menu item. 
</P>
<H4>Deleting birthdays</H4>
<P>When birthdays are deleted, we use the
"<span class="code">CBirthdaysList::GetSelectedListBoxItemsLC()</span>" routine to
get the list of indices from the markable list, in ascending order.
This routine returns <span class="code">NULL</span> for empty lists, since Symbian OS abhors a
vacuum. 
</P>
<P>To delete from the <span class="code">CArray</span>s that underlie the birthday model and
the list box model, you must delete in the reverse order (or else all
the indices will be changing while you're deleting them).
"<span class="code">CBirthdayList::DeleteBirthdaysL()</span>" deletes both from the
model and then from the list box using the generated
"<span class="code">CBirthdayList::DeleteSelectedListBoxItemsL()</span>" method.
(Remember again that in this application we maintain an identical
ordering of items for these two arrays, so the same indices can be
used when deleting from both arrays.)</P>
<H4>Loading and saving data in the form</H4>
<P>We want the form to work with the current birthday. When a new
birthday is added, however, we want to see the designer-specified
default values in the form rather than empty strings. 
</P>
<P>We add a method "<span class="code">CBirthdayForm::SetBirthday(TBirthday*,
TBool)</span>" to set a reference to the birthday it is operating on,
with the final parameter indicating whether the birthday is empty or
not. This controls whether the form is initially populated from the
birthday or from the designer default values.</P>
<P>The UI Designer provides a "<span class="code">CBirthdayForm::LoadFromDataL()</span>"
method which initializes the form editors upon construction. Here, we
read the birthday's data and update the editors, if needed. The
standard "<span class="code">CAknForm::SaveFormDataL()</span>" method is used to
save changed data. We edit this method to write editor values back to
the birthday.</P>
<P>We add the "<span class="code">CBirthdayForm::IsBirthdayChanged()</span>" method
is used to detect whether the user made and saved any changes to the
current birthday. The return value from "<span class="code">CBirthdayForm::RunLD()</span>"
is <I>not</I> sufficient to detect whether changes were made, since
this value reflects the softkey used to exit the dialog, and is
always 0, since the user must use Back to do this.</P>
