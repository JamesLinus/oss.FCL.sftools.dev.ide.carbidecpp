<h2>Tutorial: Birthdays - Using the S60 UI Designer</h2>
<P>This example shows how to use the Carbide.c++ UI Designer for S60 to define the UI of an application and to implement the "real work" in the generated code. </P>
<P>The goals of the application are to:</P>

<h3><FONT FACE="Albany, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Using the S60 UI
Designer</FONT></FONT></h3>
<P>We want the UI to mirror the birthday information, in this case. 
</P>
<P>A list box shows the birthdays, with name and date/age fields and
an icon on each line. The person's name and birthday are always
displayed. If a birthday is coming up in the next week, the icon
indicates this, and the lucky person's age is displayed next to the
date. This list will always be present, so it will be the primary
Avkon view for the application.</P>
<P>A birthday is edited with a form, where a to-do note can be
edited. Since this will come up at various times throughout the
application lifecycle and needs to pass data back and forth with the
list, we will make this a dialog rather than an Avkon view.</P>
<H4>Project creation</H4>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The initial project was created using
the "C++ Application for S60" wizard with the "S60
3rd. Ed. GUI Application with UI Designer" template.
The initial view we created was the list box, though it could have
been the form.</P>
<H4>Application Design</H4>
<P>Open the Application Editor by opening <span class="code">"application.uidesign"</span>
or selecting the "Open Carbide.c++ Application Design"
item from the project's context menu. Select the "UI Designs"
tab. This shows the designs used for this project. 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><span class="code">BirthdaysList.uidesign</span>: a list box showing all the birthdays.
	This is the initial view, and is an Avkon view.</P>
	<LI><P><span class="code">BirthdayForm.uidesign</span>: a form for editing one birthday. This
	is a dialog, constructed at runtime.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Birthdays List Design</H3>
<P>Open "<span class="code">BirthdaysList.uidesign</span>." This is a list box
showing the birthdays.</P>
<H4>List box characteristics</H4>
<P>The list is configured for "Double Large" style. This
allows us to show the person's name in large print with the date in
small type underneath. An icon is shown on the left.</P>
<P>The list box has the "markable" list type. This allows
you to select one or more items at runtime and act on them in a
group. In this mode, the designer shows the mark icon on each item
(this has no relation to whether an item is marked initially &ndash;
no items are marked by default at runtime).</P>
<P>The list box will have no static data, so it is drawn with the "No
data" label. No List Box Items are present.</P>
<H4>Non-layout components</H4>
<P>There are two components in the lower half of the view editor: the
<b>Options</b> menu and the "remove" confirmation query. You can
select these to see and edit the UI they will present when popped up.
</P>
<P>The <b>Options</b> menu contains the commands we will publish:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>Add</B>: open a form used to add a new birthday.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Edit</B>: modify the content of a birthday.</P>
	<LI><P><B>Mark/unmark</B>: show submenu for item selection. The UI
	Designer automatically provides this system menu pane (submenu) when
	you change the type to "markable." (You may also add
	this via the "System Markable List Menu Pane"
	component.) 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Delete</B>: delete marked birthdays from the list (when
	these people no longer want your novelty ties), asking first for
	confirmation with the "remove" confirmation query.</P>
</UL>
<H3>Birthday Form Design</H3>
<P>Open "<span class="code">BirthdayForm.uidesign</span>." This form is used to
edit a single birthday entry. 
</P>
<P>This is a dialog, created and displayed on demand. We specified
this by unchecking the "Support view switching" checkbox
on the last page of the "S60 UI Design" wizard when
creating the form. In the S60 UI Designer, there is no explicit
mention of a dialog, but a form is a dialog. If a form is contained
in a view, it does not pop up like a dialog, and is visible as long
as the view is showing.</P>
<H4>Form characteristics</H4>
<P>The "waiting" option is enabled, so we can run the
dialog and get a response from the <span class="code">RunLD()</span> 
call. In an Avkon view,
this flag is unset. If the dialog does not wait, <span class="code">RunLD()</span> returns
immediately and extra code is required to asynchronously notify the
application it is closed; in an Avkon view, the form is destroyed
when the view is deactivated.</P>
<P>The "double spaced format" option is enabled, since
the form has so few lines and space is not a premium.</P>
<P>The "edit mode only" option is enabled, so editing is
immediately possible. 
</P>
<H4>Form editors</H4>
<P>The form has two text editors (<span class="code">CEikEdwin</span>) for the name and to-do
fields, and a date editor (<span class="code">CEikDateEditor</span>) for the birth date. These
are not changed from the defaults, except for the default text and
prompt.</P>
