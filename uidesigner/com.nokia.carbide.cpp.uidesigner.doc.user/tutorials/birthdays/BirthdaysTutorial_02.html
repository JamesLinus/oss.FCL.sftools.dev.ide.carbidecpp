<h3>Maintaining UI / Data Separation</h3>
<P>We want to define a record for a birthday and a list of birthdays,
but not tie this to the UI that displays or edits it. The UI, of
course, must be able to read and write birthdays, so the term
"separation" really refers to separation of ownership. So
in this application, birthday information is owned by the
application, and the UI derives its content from and contributes to
this information.</P>
<P>The <span class="code">TBirthday.cpp</span> and <span class="code">.h</span>
files define the model for one birthday,
containing setters and getters for the name, date, and todo fields.
For ease of programming these are fixed-size <span class="code">TBuf</span> objects and copied
in and out without checking sizes. Since it contains no
heap-allocated storage, this is a "T" class. The
constraints on the editors in the UI ensure (hopefully) that these
buffer limits will never be exceeded. More error-checking would be
expected from a real application. 
</P>
<P>We don't provide a custom class for the list of birthdays, instead
storing these inside the <span class="code">CBirthdaysDocument</span> class. The "document"
is a standard S60 application class, used in Symbian OS to manage the
data for an application. We maintain an array of birthdays and
provide accessors for adding, removing, and accessing a TBirthday by
index.
