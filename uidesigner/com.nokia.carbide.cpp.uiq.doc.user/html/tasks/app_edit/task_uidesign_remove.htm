<h2>Removing a UI Design</h2>

<p>When you create a UI design with the UI Designer it is automatically included in the builds of the project to which you originally assign it. If you decide that you do not want that UI Design to be part of your project, you may permanently delete it or temporarily <a href="task_uidesign_remove.htm">remove it</a> from the project. </p>
<p>Later, if you wish to restore a UI Design which you have temporarily removed - or if you wish to copy a UI Design that was originally created for a different project into your project - you must import the UI Design into the project for it to be included with subsequent builds.</p>

	<p>The All UI Designs section of the UI Designs page contains a list of all UI designs currently included in the project. </p>
	<p>The checked item indicates the design  displayed when the application is started. It does not have to be the first UI design in the list. </p>
	<li>Click the UI design  to remove.</li>
	<p>The UI Design will be highlighted to indicate that it has been selected.</p>
	<li>Click <b>Remove</b></li>
	<p>The UI Design is removed from the UI Design&#8217;s list but not from the project.</p>
	<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> If you remove the checked item, the UI Designer will not check another UI Design for you automatically. You must check the box for the UI Design which you wish to be displayed when the application starts.</p>
	<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b> These changes will not become permanent until your next save of the application.uidesign file.</p>
