  <h4 align="left">Command Page Sections</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p align="left"><b>Command Lists: </b>This section is composed of 
		two sections: the tree command and the action buttons. The tree shows 
		the commands structure. Also, buttons allow to add 
		new lists, commands, create nameGroups and anonymousGroups, duplicate 
		commands, edit images (for command and namedGroup) and remove components<b>. </b> </p>
		</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><b>Command List Details:</b> This section allows you to edit the 
	properties of each element selected from the tree. The properties are 
	enabled or disabled depending on the selected component.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left"><b>Command IDs:</b> This section allows you to edit some 
	properties of the component Command IDs; the functions of this section 
	are: <br>
	- Renaming the Command ID component <br>
	- Changing the property CommandID (by typing in a new value)&nbsp; or selecting a CommandID from system <br>

</ul>
</div>

<p>The command properties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Anonymous Group</b> - The AnonymousGroup component is referenced by
    Commands and Named Groups. Commands and Named Groups that reference the same
    Anonymous Group will be displayed together. It is allowed to exist as a
    child of a CommandList component because of its inheritance from
    CommandListChildBase.</li>
  <li><b>Command </b>- The Command component is allowed to exist as a child of
    a CommandList component because of its inheritance from CommandListChildBase.
    It also inherits functionality from the CommandBase component.</li>
  <li><b>Command Id</b>- The CommandId component is referenced by Commands
    from different CommandLists. It exists as a child of the CommandLists
    component.</li>
  <li><b>Command List</b> - A set of Commands that can be referenced by a View/Dialog
    or Layout.</li>
  <li><b>Named Group</b> - The NamedGroup component is referenced by Commands,
    AnonymousGroups and other NamedGroups instances. Commands, AnonymousGroups
    and NamedGroups that reference the same NamedGroup will be displayed as sub-items. It is allowed to exist as a child of a CommandList component because
    of its inheritance from CommandListChildBase. It also inherits functionality from the CommandBase component. </li>
