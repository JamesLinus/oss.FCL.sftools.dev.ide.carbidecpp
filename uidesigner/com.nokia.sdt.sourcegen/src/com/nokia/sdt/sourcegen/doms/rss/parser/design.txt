
The RssParser class will use CDT to tokenize and preprocess the
files making up an RSS file.  The parser constructs a DOM, which
is constructed of nodes, each of which has a starting file and 
source offset plus an ending file and source offset.  Each node's 
source range incorporates the source ranges of its children.

After this token-level parse, we iterate the CDT scanner's
preprocessor statements from the DOM scanner.  This tells us 
where macros are defined,
where includes happen, where #if/#endif appear, etc.  We will
incorporate these into our DOM so they fit properly (i.e. they
contain the source ranges of child DOM nodes, etc).  With a
little effort we can determine where macro expansions occurred
as well.

We infer the location of whitespace and comments by taking the
leftover bits and encode these as uninterpreted plain text.

We only construct the DOM and its detailed preprocessor information 
for files that UI Designer will write out again.  (The parser has 
already generated type information from headers, etc.)

For our purposes, we impose the restriction that preprocessor 
statements cannot break nodes.  E.g.:

#if FOO
STRUCT THIS {
#else
STRUCT THAT {
#endif
	...
}

is not allowed.  In such a case we will ignore the category of
the preprocessor statement and encode it as plain text, e.g.:

if FOO is defined to non-zero:

PLAIN { "...\n#if FOO" }
STRUCT THIS {
	PLAIN { "#else\nSTRUCT THAT{\n#endif" }
	contents
}

else

PLAIN { "...\n#if FOO\nSTRUCT THIS{\n#else\n" }
STRUCT THAT {
	PLAIN { "#endif\n" }
	contents
}

Inside AST nodes, we store references to the original text in the
the ISourceRange member.  Such a node is ignored if a node or
any of its children are modified.  Thus, when rewriting source, 
unchanged elements of the DOM are written out by referencing the
original source, while changed elements are constructed anew.
Only actually modified nodes are rewritten; thus, a node with
three children in which only one is modified will have 67% original
source with a regenerated segment of text inside.
