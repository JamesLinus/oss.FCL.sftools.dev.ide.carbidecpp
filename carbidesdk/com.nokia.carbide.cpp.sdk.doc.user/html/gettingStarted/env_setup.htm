<h2>Setting up your development environment</h2>
<p>This section will describe how to set up a basic Eclipse development environment 
to develop a plugin against the Carbide.c++ development environment.</p>

<h3><a name="download" id="download"></a>Download the Carbide.c++ Development Kit (CDK) </h3>
<p>Carbide.c++  is developed against the Eclipse 3.4 release build which includes the Java Development Tools (JDT) and Plug-in Development Environment (PDE). You will need these items as well as the Carbide.c++/CDT source code to develop Eclipse/Carbide.c++ plug-ins. If you want to install the CDK you will need to run the Software Updates under the Help menu to update your installation to include the CDK. </p>
<p>For more information on running the Software Updater please see the page <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.nokia.carbide.cpp.doc.user/html/tasks/start/carbide_updating.htm">Updating Carbide.c++</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="setup" id="setup"></a>Importing source projects </h3>

<p>Once you have your Carbide environment updated to include the CDK, you can create new Eclipse plug-in projects and debug the Carbide.c++ sources. How to create eclipse plug-ins is beyond the scope of this demonstration. If you want to debug any of the Carbide.c++ or Ecilpse platform source follow these steps to verify your CDK isntallation: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Switch to the <strong>Plug-in Development</strong> perspective. </li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Plug-ins</strong> view. </li>
  <li>Select the binary plug-in you want view the source of. Don't select the *source feature.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the plug-in you want to import and select <strong>Import As &gt; Source Project</strong>. For example, the <span class="style1">com.nokia.carbide.cpp.leavescan</span> plug-in as shown below.<br>
    <br>
  <img src="../img/import_source_project.jpg" width="706" height="459">  </li>
  <li>Now you can return to the <strong>Package Explorer</strong> view and navigate the source files for the imported plug-in. It should look like a normal plug-in project:<br>
    <br>
  <img src="../img/source_plugin.jpg" width="361" height="392"><br>
  <br>
  You can now <a href="launchconfig.htm">create a launch configuration</a> and debug Carbide. </li>
