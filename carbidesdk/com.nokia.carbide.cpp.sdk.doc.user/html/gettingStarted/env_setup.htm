<h2>Setting up your development environment</h2>
<p>This section will describe how to set up a basic Eclipse development environment 
to develop a plugin against the Carbide.c++ development environment.</p>

<h3><a name="download" id="download"></a>Download the Eclipse 3.4 SDK</h3>
<p>Carbide.c++  is developed against the Eclipse 3.4 release build. You can download the build 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">here</a>. Carbide.c++ is only tested and supported on the Windows platform.</p>
<p>You can extract the Eclipse platform anywhere you like.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>NOTE</strong> When you launch eclipse, choose a workspace location without spaces. This will help to prevent build issues later on with Symbian SDKs.</p>
<h3><a name="setup" id="setup"></a>Set-up the Target Platform</h3>

<p>Once you have your Eclipse environment extracted and launched, you can set up your <strong>Target Platform</strong> to have your fresh installation reference all the Carbide.c++/CDT/Eclipse plugins.</p>
<p>The Eclipse Target Platform feature allows you to compile and run against a different Eclipse installation than the
one you're using for development. In this case you'll be targeting the Carbide.c++ installation. The <b>Target Platform</b> is a workspace-wide setting, so you may want to dedicate a separate workspace for your Carbide.c++ plugin development. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose <strong>Window</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Plug-in Development</strong> &gt; <strong>Target Platform</strong>.</li>
  <li>Browse for the <strong>Location</strong> of your Carbide.c++ installation. This is the location that contains the <span class="style1">Carbide.c++.exe</span> and <span class="style1">plugins</span> folder. When you have chosen the new location eclipse will load the plugins found in Carbide.c++ installation you will work against. Your Target Platform preference should look something like this:<br />
    <br />
  <img src="../img/target_platform.JPG" width="740" height="584" /></li>
  <li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are now ready to import or create new projects into your Eclipse workspace.</p>
