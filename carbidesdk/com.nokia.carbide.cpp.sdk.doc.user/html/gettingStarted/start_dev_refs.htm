<h2>Developer References</h2>

<p>Other <b>Carbide.c++ User Guides</b>  provide pointers to useful technical reference materials for the S60 developer. We will not repeat those references here, with one possible exception: </p>
<p>The author of this User Guide found this text useful, but it was written when version 2.0 of the SDK was the most current version. This book does not cover any new features added to S60 in version 3.0 and above. Support for different screen layouts was added in  2nd Edition Feature Pack 3. </p>
